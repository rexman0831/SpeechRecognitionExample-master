### Speech Recognition Example
---
This example project demonstrates the usage of the new `SFSpeechRecognizer` introduced in iOS 10. 
Please check out the [API diffs](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/content/releasenotes/General/iOS10APIDiffs/Objective-C/Speech.html) for more information on the new API's.
As for now, Apple does not document much around the API, so this example might be updated over the next months.
